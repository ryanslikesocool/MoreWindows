# Launcher Window

A "Launcher" window that can be shown when an app launches.

## Overview

Launcher windows can be found across many creativity, productivity, and developer apps, such as [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/c), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and [Unity](https://unity.com/).
They provide an easy way to perform actions such as opening and creating files, and can help provide gentle guidance for new users unfamiliar with the app.
